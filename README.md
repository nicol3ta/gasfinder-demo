# gasfinder-demo
This demo project provides an example of how you can integrate your app with Cortana and use the Speech SDK. 
The sample mocks an application that finds gas stations nearby. 
Users can access it through Cortana and there is also Speech Recognition built in the app that allows users to get the best route. 
The app uses VoiceCommands in German.
